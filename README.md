### Session: Spring 2023

## Overview

#### This repository includes various Jupyter Notebooks from the lab section of COEN 140: Machine Learning & Data Mining.

## Lab 1 - Python Basics

#### Get started with Python and common libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, etc.

## Lab 2 - Feature Extraction (Bag of Words)

#### Perform feature extraction and processing on document-feature matrices.

## Lab 3 - KNN Classification

#### Use the sklearn library to perform classifications on the Iris Dataset and compute the accuracy and F1 score of the model.

## Lab 4 - Multi-Variate Linear Regression

#### Modify the provided gradient function to perform multivariate linear regression.

## Lab 5 - Dimensionality Reduction

#### Choose 2 different dimensionality reductino techniques to train the provided pipeline model. Compare the results using a scatter plot.

## Lab 6 - Ensemble Methods

#### Utilize ensemble methods to find the best performance on the Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset. Tune the best of each of the following models you can and report their F1 score on the test set: Decision Tree, Bagged Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. Using the four best models, create a voting classifier to predict the samples and report the F1 score on the test set.

## Lab 7 - K-Means Clustering

#### Using k-means, implement the bisecting k-means algorithm without the use of the sklearn library. Compare the results with the k-means scatterplots.

## Lab 8 - KNN Search

#### Implement Approximate Nearest Neighbor search using two tools of your choice. Train the models and display the recall as well as the overall time for the search process.

## Lab 9 - Association Analysis

#### Execute the association analysis using the fpgrowth and ECLAt algorithms on the provided dataset.

## Lab 10 - Feed Forward Neural Network

#### Implement multilayer neural network that can do digit classification based on the famous MNIST dataset.
